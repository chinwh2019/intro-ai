## üéì Course Philosophy

This course emphasizes:
- **Visualization** - See algorithms in action
- **Experimentation** - Try different parameters
- **Understanding** - Know why, not just how
- **Implementation** - Read and write real code
- **Application** - Connect theory to practice

**Learning is interactive, not passive!**
