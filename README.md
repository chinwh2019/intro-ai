## Overview

This project aims to provide practical implementations and demonstrations of various AI algorithms. It serves as a learning resource for students and enthusiasts interested in understanding the core concepts of Artificial Intelligence through hands-on coding examples.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following main sections:

- `search/`: Implementation of search algorithms
- `machine_learning/`: Machine learning algorithms and examples
- `reinforcement_learning/`: Reinforcement learning implementations
- `generative_ai/`: Generative AI models and examples

## Search Algorithms

The search algorithms section includes a maze solver that demonstrates the following algorithms:

- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
- A* Search

### Maze Solver

The maze solver provides a visual representation of how different search algorithms traverse a randomly generated maze. It allows users to compare the performance and behavior of various search strategies.

Key features:
- Random maze generation
- Real-time visualization of algorithm progress
- Performance comparison (time taken and nodes expanded)
- Interactive controls for algorithm selection and maze regeneration

For more details on the maze solver, refer to the [SEARCH.md](search/SEARCH.md) file.
