## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Problem:** Pygame window not appearing
```bash
# Solution 1: Reinstall pygame
pip uninstall pygame
pip install pygame

# Solution 2: Check display settings
import pygame
pygame.display.init()
```

**Problem:** Import errors
```bash
# Solution: Add project to Python path
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/intro-ai"

# Or in Python:
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, '/path/to/intro-ai')
```

**Problem:** Slow performance
```python
# Solution: Reduce visualization complexity
from modules.search.config import config
config.SHOW_EXPLORED = False
config.ANIMATION_SPEED = 5.0
```

**Problem:** Colab doesn't support pygame
```python
# Solution: Use Colab-specific version
from modules.search.colab_main import run_search_colab
run_search_colab('bfs', maze_size=(20, 15))
```
