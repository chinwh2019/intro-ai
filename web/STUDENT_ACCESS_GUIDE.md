## üéØ Learning Activities

### Activity 1: Compare Algorithms

**Goal:** Understand efficiency differences

1. Press **1** to run BFS
2. Watch it explore level-by-level
3. Note the "Nodes Expanded" count
4. Press **R** to reset with same maze
5. Press **4** to run A*
6. Compare: Which expanded fewer nodes?

**Question:** Why is A* more efficient?

### Activity 2: Test on Different Mazes

**Goal:** See how algorithms handle various layouts

1. Press **T** to enable random mode (sidebar shows "Random: ON")
2. Press **R** to generate new maze
3. Press **4** to run A*
4. Repeat steps 2-3 several times
5. Observe: Does A* always find a path?

**Question:** Is A* always optimal?

### Activity 3: Understand Exploration Patterns

**Goal:** See how algorithms explore differently

1. Generate a new maze (Press **R**)
2. Run BFS (Press **1**)
   - Notice it expands evenly in all directions
3. Press **R** to reset
4. Run DFS (Press **2**)
   - Notice it goes deep in one direction
5. Press **R** to reset
6. Run A* (Press **4**)
   - Notice it heads toward the goal

**Question:** Which exploration pattern is best? When?

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### App Not Loading?

**Problem:** Stuck on "Loading..." for > 1 minute

**Solutions:**
1. Check your internet connection
2. Try refreshing the page (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
3. Try a different browser (Chrome recommended)
4. Clear browser cache
5. Check if your school/work blocks GitHub Pages

### Controls Not Working?

**Problem:** Pressing keys does nothing

**Solutions:**
1. Click on the app window to focus it
2. Make sure you're not in a text input field
3. Try clicking the black game area
4. Refresh the page

### App Runs Slowly?

**Problem:** Laggy or low frame rate

**Solutions:**
1. Close other browser tabs
2. Use Chrome or Firefox (usually fastest)
3. On mobile: Close other apps
4. Try smaller maze size (if you can modify config)

### Black Screen?

**Problem:** App loads but shows black screen

**Solutions:**
1. Wait 5 more seconds (initial render)
2. Press **R** to reset
3. Check browser console for errors (F12)
4. Try different browser

## üì± Mobile Device Tips

### For Best Experience on Mobile

**Orientation:**
- Use **landscape mode** (turn device sideways)
- Portrait mode works but cramped

**Touch Controls:**
- Tap the number buttons if visible
- Or connect Bluetooth keyboard for controls

**Performance:**
- Close other apps
- Use WiFi (not cellular for first load)
- Modern phones work great (iPhone 12+, recent Android)

## üí° Tips for Learning

1. **Start with A*** - It's the most efficient algorithm
   - Press **4** immediately

2. **Use step mode** to understand
   - Press **SPACE** to pause
   - Press **S** to step through slowly
   - Watch exactly how the algorithm explores

3. **Compare on same maze**
   - Run one algorithm
   - Press **R** to reset (keeps same maze)
   - Run different algorithm
   - Compare statistics

4. **Try random mode**
   - Press **T** to enable
   - Press **R** multiple times
   - See how algorithms handle different layouts

5. **Read the sidebar**
   - Nodes Expanded = efficiency
   - Lower is better for same path length

## üîó Sharing and Collaboration

### Share Your Results

1. Take a screenshot when solution is found
2. Note the algorithm and statistics
3. Share with classmates or instructor
4. Discuss: Why did you choose that algorithm?

### Collaborate

- Share interesting maze configurations
- Compare who found the most efficient solution
- Challenge: Find a maze where DFS beats BFS!

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Do I need to install anything?**
A: No! Just visit the URL in your browser.

**Q: Does it work on my Chromebook?**
A: Yes! Chromebooks are fully supported.

**Q: Can I use this on my phone?**
A: Yes! Use landscape mode for best experience.

**Q: Is my data/progress saved?**
A: Currently no - it's reset when you reload. This is a learning tool, not a game to progress through.

**Q: Can I modify the code?**
A: Not directly in the web version. For code modification, use the downloadable version or Google Colab notebooks.

**Q: Why does it take long to load the first time?**
A: It's downloading Python + Pygame (~8 MB). Cached after first load!

**Q: Does it work offline?**
A: After first load, it mostly works offline (browser cache). But first load requires internet.

**Q: Can I use this for my homework?**
A: Yes! That's exactly what it's for. Experiment and learn!
